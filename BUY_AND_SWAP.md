# Fiat Router Buy and Swap Documentation

## Overview

Fiat Router is a seamless gateway that allows users to **buy cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies** and **swap between different cryptocurrencies** efficiently. This documentation covers the **Buy** and **Swap** features, guiding users and developers on how to interact with these functionalities.

## Buy Section

### What is the Buy Feature?

The Buy feature enables users to convert their traditional fiat money (e.g., USD, EUR, NGN) into cryptocurrencies directly within the Fiat Router platform. This eliminates the need for multiple intermediaries, providing a fast, secure, and compliant onramp to crypto.

### How It Works

1. User selects fiat currency and the cryptocurrency they want to buy.
2. User enters the amount they wish to spend or receive.
3. Fiat Router aggregates liquidity providers and routes the transaction to get the best price and lowest fees.
4. User completes payment via supported methods (bank transfer, credit/debit card, etc.).
5. Purchased cryptocurrency is deposited into the user’s linked crypto wallet instantly or within a short processing time.
6. Transaction details and receipts are available for user review.

### Supported Fiat and Crypto

- Fiat currencies: USD, EUR, NGN, and others.
- Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDC, and more.

### User Benefits

## Swap Section

### What is the Swap Feature?

The Swap feature allows users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly on the Fiat Router platform, leveraging aggregated liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized sources.

### How It Works

1. User selects the input cryptocurrency and the output cryptocurrency.
2. User enters the amount to swap.
3. Fiat Router’s Smart Order Router finds the best rates across multiple liquidity sources.
4. User confirms the swap details including price, fees, and estimated transaction time.
5. The swap is executed on-chain or via integrated liquidity providers.
6. Swapped tokens are delivered to the user’s wallet.
