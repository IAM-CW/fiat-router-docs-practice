# Fiat Router

## A Quick Summary

Fiat Router is a fluid gateway that makes it easy for users to effectively swap different cryptocurrencies and buy cryptocurrencies using fiat currency (Naira for now).

This README is a guide on how the **Buy** and **Swap** features work on Fiat Router so developers and users can get a hang of it.

## Buy Section

Through the Buy feature, users can directly exchange their traditional fiat currency (NGN for now) for cryptocurrencies within the Fiat Router platform.

This helps get rid of the need for numerous middlemen, and offers a quick, safe, and legal onramp to cryptocurrency.

### How It Works

1. You put in your phone number.
2. Select Wallet to connect.  
   *(If you don’t want to connect it, you can just paste your wallet address.)*
3. Or use a custom wallet address.
4. Select Token (e.g., SOL).  
   *(If the token isn’t listed, you can add it manually.)*
5. Or use a custom token address.
6. Input the amount (NGN) you’d like to buy.  
   *(The minimum amount is ₦1,500 and the maximum is ₦40,000.)*  
   *(There is also a 0.5% Paga payment charge.)*
7. Proceed to make a payment.

There are 5 ways to make a payment: Card, Paga, Transfer, Agent, USSD.

Choose which you’d prefer, and after paying, confirm your payment in seconds by clicking the green **“Paid”** button.

And that’s it! You will get your tokens immediately and also get your transaction details on Solscan.
